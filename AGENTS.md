This repository is an Xcode project for an iOS app named EchoEdit. The top-level folder `EchoEdit` along with `EchoEdit.xcodeproj` contains the Swift source used in Xcode.

A copy of the Cloudflare Worker lives under the `.claude` directory inside `EchoEdit` (see `EchoEdit/.claude/`). This worker is only provided so you can view and modify the worker code. It is not automatically deployed. After editing the worker, you must push your changes to Cloudflare manually (for example with `wrangler deploy`).

There are currently no automated tests for this project.
